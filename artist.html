<h1> Artist Statement</h1>

<br>
<br>
<p> My goal in this world is to create something that is a visual representation of how I think and be able to communicate that properly to others.

My work this semester has been revolved around pushing boundaries of what I am comfortable with in what I have been taught in the design community and what is considered "part of the rules"<p>

<p>“When you go independent, if you fail, you’re totally responsible for it. If you succeed, you’re totally responsible for it. But the thing is, you are responsible for who you are. And what you do, and what you make. And I believe that that is the most important thing – at least for me on a personal level. I’d rather fail and be responsible for it than succeed and not be responsible for it.” - Tablo <p>
